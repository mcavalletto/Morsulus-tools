    <h2>Welcome to the Ordinary &amp; Armorial of the SCA</h2>
    <p>
        This O&amp;A is a web-based searchable database of the names and armory registered by <a href="http://heraldry.sca.org">the College of Arms</a> of <a href="http://sca.org">the Society for Creative Anachronism</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use these tools to find registered names and armory:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="generous"> <style> ul.generous li { margin-top: 1em; } </style>
    <li>
        <a href="XXIndexDirUrlXX/"><strong>The Ordinary</strong></a> provides an index of currently-registered armory based on a description of the field or charges they contain. The Ordinary is useful for finding armory based on a picture, or for conflict-checking new armory submissions. The Ordinary works in conjunction with the <a href="XXDescSearchUrlXX"><strong>Armory Description Search Form</strong></a> which shows registered items that appear under a particular heading.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="XXNpSearchUrlXX"><strong>The Name Pattern Search Form</strong></a> finds items associated with a name. The pattern feature matches partial names and supports wildcards, so you can use it even if you don't know the exact spelling of the full name. There's also an exact-match <a href="XXNameSearchUrlXX"><strong>Name Search Form</strong></a> which only works if you have the exact spelling of the full name.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="XXBpSearchUrlXX"><strong>The Blazon Pattern Search Form</strong></a> finds armory whose blazon contains particular words or text patterns. This tool can be useful, but should not be used for conflict checking, for which the Ordinary and the Armory Description Search Form are better suited. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="XXDateSearchUrlXX"><strong>The Date/Kingdom Search Form</strong></a> allows you to search for registrations during a particular time-period or via a particular kingdom.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="XXComplexSearchUrlXX"><strong>The Complex Search Form</strong></a> allows you to do sophisticated searches on the database by combining the results of multiple queries.  This form is tricky to use, but when configured properly can facilitate research and speed up armory conflict-checking.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="XXAboutOandaPageUrlXX"><strong>The About Page</strong></a> explains the purpose of this site, links to some helpful pages, and explains how to download the data files it uses.
    </li>
</ul>
